- Create .env file and put the following definition for DB url
  ```js
  DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/sleeper";
  ```
- **TODO**: What else is needed?
- Finally start the server with `npm run dev`

### Client

# Sleep Tracker App - Potential Improvements and Additional Features

## Additional Features

### 1. Sleep Quality Analysis
- **Description:** Implement a feature that allows users to input or automatically track sleep quality metrics such as restfulness, interruptions, and dream recall. 
- **Value:** This feature would provide users with deeper insights into their sleep patterns, helping them identify factors affecting their sleep quality.

### 2. Integration with Wearable Devices
- **Description:** Integrate the app with wearable devices like smartwatches or fitness trackers to automatically gather sleep data.
- **Value:** Automated data collection would improve the accuracy of sleep tracking and reduce the effort required by users to log their sleep manually.

### 3. Sleep Recommendations and Insights
- **Description:** Based on users' sleep data, the app could offer personalized sleep recommendations, such as ideal bedtimes, relaxation techniques, or adjustments to sleep environment.
- **Value:** Providing actionable insights and recommendations could help users improve their sleep habits and overall health.

### 4. Social Sharing and Community Features
- **Description:** Enable users to share their sleep achievements or challenges with friends or within a community of users.
- **Value:** Social features could increase user engagement and motivation by allowing users to connect with others who have similar sleep goals.

## Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Data Visualization
- **Description:** Improve the app's data visualization capabilities by adding more detailed and interactive charts, such as weekly/monthly trends, correlations between sleep duration and quality, etc.
- **Impact:** Better data visualization would help users understand their sleep patterns more clearly and make more informed decisions.

### 2. Optimized Performance and Scalability
- **Description:** Optimize the app's backend to handle large volumes of data efficiently, particularly as the user base grows.
- **Impact:** Ensuring that the app remains responsive and reliable, even with a large number of users, would improve user experience and retention.

### 3. Comprehensive Testing Suite
- **Description:** Develop a more extensive testing suite that includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for both the frontend and backend.
- **Impact:** This would increase the reliability of the app and reduce the likelihood of bugs or issues in production.

### 4. Improved User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
- **Description:** Refine the UI design to make it more intuitive, visually appealing, and accessible. Consider adding features like dark mode, customizable themes, and more user-friendly navigation.
- **Impact:** A better-designed UI/UX would enhance user satisfaction and make the app more appealing to a broader audience.

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Scalability
- **Consideration:** With more time, consider optimizing database queries, improving caching mechanisms, and using a more scalable architecture (e.g., microservices) to ensure the app can handle increased user load.

### 2. Security Enhancements
- **Consideration:** Implement stricter authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), and ensure that all sensitive user data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.

### 3. Integration with Third-Party Services
- **Consideration:** Explore integrating the app with third-party health APIs (like Apple Health or Google Fit) to provide users with a more comprehensive view of their health and wellness.
